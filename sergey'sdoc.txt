Hello B2evolution team!
I'm a Sergey.
I did add and modify some files of the b2evolution framework.
As my first code, I change the skin named "skins/bootstrap_main_skin".
So you can my gift part in the main front-page.

My first code is my little gift for you. When you click that gift,you can see three team member's name.

I did following. Of cource, I think I consider of the rule in b2evolution.
1. added file named "front.main.php" in "skins/bootstrp_main_skin/".
	I think this is main skin when the post type requested is "front",$dist=front. 
	If this file named "front.main.php" isn't in proper skins folder, the framework seems to call file named "index.main.php";
	So I creat new "front.main.php" file in that skin folder.
    And then to get members name, I used the query and execute that by using get_results() function of $DB golbal object in your framework. 
2. added some css in style.css file.
    This is needed to fix css property of my sergey_gift_div in "front.main.php".

3. creat the js folder, and then add gift_core.js file in that.
    This file is needed to handle my "sergey_gift_div" in jQuery javascript.
	The function is to flip two face divs.
4. change file named "_skin.class.php" and add snippet code.
    Because this is needed to load my javascript file named "gift_core.js".
	I add the code in display_init() hook.

I hope it gives a little satisfaction to you.
Best regard.
Sergey.

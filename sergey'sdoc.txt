Hello B2evolution team!
I'm a Sergey.

I added and modified some files of the b2evolution framework.
As my first code, I prepared a gift for your team.
You'll maybe see my 'gift' in the main front-page.
When you click "gift",you can see three team member's name.

For the "gift" I changed the skin, named "skins/bootstrap_main_skin".

I did following as. 

1. adding "front.main.php" file in the "skins/bootstrp_main_skin/".
	I think this is main skin's file when the post type is "front",$dist=front. 
	And I think that "b2evolution" runs "front.main.php" file,if there isn't the file in proper skins folder.
	And in order to get team members name, I used the query and executed it by using get_results() method of $DB object. 
	
2. adding some css in style.css file.
    	For fixing css property of my sergey_gift_div, I added styles.
    
3. adding "js" folder in the skin folder, and creating "gift_core.js" file in that folder.
    	This file is for handle flipping of my "sergey_gift_div".
    	This file is presented in jQuery.
    	
4. modifying "_skin.class.php" file.
	For loading "gift_core.js" file, I added a snippet code in display_init() function.

I'm sorry of my little understanding about "b2evolution" framework.
But I hope you're enjoying with my gift.

Best regard.
Sergey.

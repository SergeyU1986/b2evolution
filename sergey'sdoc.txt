Hello B2evolution team!
I'm Sergey.

I added and modified some files of the "b2evolution" system.
As my first code, I prepared a gift for your team.
You'll maybe see my 'gift' in the main front-page.
When you click "gift",you can see three team member's name.

For the "gift" I changed the skin, named "skins/bootstrap_main_skin".

I did following as. 

1. modified "front.main.php" file in the "skins/bootstrp_main_skin/".
	I think System runs firstly this as front page when the post type is "front",$dist=front. 
	If there isn't this file in proper skins folder, system runs "index.main.php" file,.
	And in order to get team members name, I used the query and executed it by using get_results() method of $DB object. 
	
2. added some css in style.css file.
    	For fixing css property of my sergey_gift_div, I added styles.
    
3. added new "js" folder in the skin folder, and created "gift_core.js" file in it.
    	This file is for flipping of my "sergey_gift_div".
    	
4. modified "_skin.class.php" file.
	For loading "gift_core.js" file, I added a snippet code in display_init() function.

I'm sorry of my little understanding about "b2evolution" framework.
But I hope you're enjoying with my gift.

Best regard.
Sergey.
